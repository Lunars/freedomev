#an example of a constructive way to use tmpfs
#as many end users report broken eMMC we can drastically reduce the amount of erase cycles
#in certain cases we might loose log information (Linux kernel crash due to eMMC, RAM or power supply issues)
#we find it an acceptable tradeoff as we copy the logfiles to the real /var prior to a reboot
#and tell users to disable this functionality prior to remote analysis by Tesla Service
#
#Hope it makes the cars more futureproof - if someone at Tesla reads this, feel free to recycle this into a future
#so all users can enjoy it. Probably a good idea to use a variable to check at startup if you want this enabled or
#not, so that it can be disabled for better remote troubleshooting. And while your at it, reduce the amount of 
#logging being kept as it will fill up precious RAM or /var space. Thanks, you are doing great work!

mount -t tmpfs -o size=1500k,nr_inodes=200 tmpfs /var/log
#if we mount while the programs are still active and they keep their logfiles open, they keep on writing to the
#(now hidden) location on the eMMC, so we need to restart or send the HUP signal (if it's properly impemented)
mkdir /var/log/ntpstats /var/log/mgetty
service ntp restart
pkill -HUP valhalla_server
restart rsyslog
#we dont restart X wich will keep logging to Xorg.0.log on the /var/log eMMC location.
#as it would be a bad fix for this problem. In any case X doesnt log a lot afer startup
#and it would be just be better to mount tmpfs prior to launching any of this
#if we start freedomev earlier in the boot process (which might be forced upon us by Tesla 'fixing' things)
#we can add this at the appropriate location (please Tesla don't be motivated to make our life more difficult,
#the solution will become less elegant over time otherwise).
